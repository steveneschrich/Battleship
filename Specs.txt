    - start a Thread
      - if connecting, connect
      - if serving, start a server
    - TextChatServer.write(CharBuffer buf)
    - synchronzied TextChatServer.read(CharBuffer buf) 
    - (something like that anyway)
    - TextChatServer.addActionListener
      - listens for new chats
  - Create TextChatView
    - is an actionListener on TextChat
    - when it actionPerformed is called, use the read methods to read the chat
      in and write it into the gui
    - When a new chat is sent, load it into a CharBuffer and write it

## Part Three:
  - Add the ai
  
## Part Four: Polish
### Estimated time: 2-3 hours
  - Do testing: Important!
  - Add images: Less Important.
  - Make a better way to connect to another player (e.g. search local network):
    Probably not that worthwhile, depending on how much time I have
